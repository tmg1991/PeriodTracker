# PeriodTracker

This app can be used to track your periods. The day of the occurance can be stored so the remaining days will be calculated. The historical data can be accessed as well as nominal and personalized future dates. Personalized future dates are calculated based on user's historical data using moving average window with the length of 3 months.  
Android Widget is available.
